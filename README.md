# Terraform Provider for Jamf Pro

This repository hosts the Jamf Pro Community Provider, built to integrate Jamf Pro's robust configuration management capabilities with Terraform's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach. Utilizing an advanced JAMF SDK, which serves as a cohesive abstraction layer over both Jamf Pro and Jamf Pro Classic APIs, this provider ensures seamless API interactions and brings a wide array of resources under Terraform's management umbrella. The jamfpro provider is engineered to enrich your CI/CD workflows with Jamf Pro's extensive device management functionalities, encompassing device enrollment, inventory tracking, security compliance, and streamlined software deployment. Its primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of managing, deploying, and maintaining Apple devices across your infrastructure, fostering a synchronized and effective IT ecosystem.
